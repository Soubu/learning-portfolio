# 🖥️ PC Maintenance & Assembly

We participated in a hands-on PC Maintenance and Assembly session held at the Software Innovation Lab (Lab Inovasi Perisian), Room 322-02, Level 3, Block N28. The session was conducted in groups and guided by experienced UTM technicians, providing practical exposure to real computer hardware components and standard maintenance procedures.

During the session, we gained direct experience in identifying internal PC components such as the hard disk, power supply unit, motherboard, and internal cables. We learned how each component functions within a computer system, as well as the correct procedures for assembling and maintaining a personal computer. Proper handling and safety techniques were emphasized to prevent damage to hardware components.

The technicians provided clear step-by-step guidance throughout the session, ensuring that each group was actively involved in the assembly process. This interactive learning approach strengthened our understanding of Chapter 2: Computer Hardware by directly linking theoretical concepts with practical application.

At the end of the session, we completed a short quiz related to the topics covered. The quiz reinforced our understanding of computer hardware concepts and highlighted the importance of accuracy, careful observation, and attention to detail.
